## Assignment
- Create a StackOverflow-style questiona nd answer site
- It should allow users to post questions/answers
- It should allow users to vote on questions/answers
- It should allow question author to select the best answer
- It should allow non-users to see questions/answers, but not vote on them.

## Learning Goals
- Explore ActiveRecord/DB relationships, particularly polymorphic associations
- Practice using AJAX to streamline user experience and avoid page reloads
- Focus on building MVP before moving on to additional features
- At one point we swapped our codebase with another team (we also swapped back), to underscore the importance of clean and readable code.https://github.com/mattbarackman/dbc_overflow
